  <h3>Your passphrase powers a <a href='https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet' target='_new'>brainwallet</a></h3>
  <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> when creating a brainwallet to use a passphrase that has a very high level of entropy. <blockquote>If this is not done, theft of the brainwallet is an eventual certainty.</blockquote></p>
  <p>This is not a simple suggestion. This is a requirement. Most people when asked to create a secure password, with everything they've heard about creating a password, will still create a password that if used for a brainwallet, will result in the eventual theft of their funds. <blockquote>The simple fact of the matter is that hacking a brainwallet password is a mathematical exercise that requires no internet access, no communication, and leaves no trace.</blockquote> <strong>Hackers can collectively try multiple trillions of passwords every second in the privacy of their own homes with the very same equipment they use for mining bitcoins</strong> (in the usual sense). Your bank might tell you that a 10 character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols is a strong password, but it is not strong enough to secure a brainwallet. A password that might be strong enough for traditional banking or a social website is typically unacceptable for a brainwallet.</p>
  <p><blockquote>A brainwallet passphrase, at a minimum, needs to be an entirely original sentence that does not appear in any song or literature.</blockquote> Security is enhanced simply by including some sort of memorable personal information, which doesn't necessarily even have to be secret (e.g. an e-mail address, or phone number). A good brainwallet passphrase will have dozens of characters.</p>
